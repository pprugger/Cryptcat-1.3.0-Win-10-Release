I just changed a few lines in the code:

File: NETCAT.c
Commented lines 1704 to 1745
Created new code after this block, because i just don't like this behavior.
If the program is started without arguments now the help will be displayed.
Without my changes the arguments can also be inserted AFTER the program was started.

File: doexec.c
Line 440
Changed RecvBuffer to Buffer
RecvBuffer is not existent in the whole project, also in none of the Libraries.
Out of the codeflow i assumed it should be Buffer.

File: twofish2.cpp
A few counter variables were not declarated as int, added it. 


The whole project is compiled WITHOUT the GAPING_SECURITY_HOLE define!
If you want to compile it with the define go to:
Project -> Settings -> C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor definitions 
and add 
GAPING_SECURITY_HOLE
